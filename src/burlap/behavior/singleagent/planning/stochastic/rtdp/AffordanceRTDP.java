/**
 * Implementation of Affordance-Aware [2] Real-time dynamic programming [1]. The planning algorithm uses a Q-value derived policy to sample rollouts in the domain. During
 * each step of the rollout, the current state has its value updated using the Bellman operator and the action for the current state
 * is selected using a greedy Q policy in which ties are randomly broken. Affordances are used to prune away irrelevant actions from the considered action set in each state.
 * <p/>
 * To ensure optimality, an optimistic value function initialization should be used. However, RTDP excels when a good value function initialization
 * (e.g., an admissible heuristic) can be provided.
 * 
 * Note: SoftAffordances are (as of yet) required to work with ARTDP - HardAffordances may be used only two value functions, where the first is initialized optimistically
 * to encourage exploration, and the second is initialized pessimistically. During rollouts, the optimistic value function is used, but during each bellman update, both
 * value functions are updated. This is not currently implemented, but is an option for those interested in HardAffordances.
